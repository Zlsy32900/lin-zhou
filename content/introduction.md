I finished my bachelor degree in Heilongjiang University, Harbin, China. I studied civil engineering - Hydraulic Engineering.

I graduated sixth in my major with a GPA of 90, which provided me with a strong foundation in mathematics and physics. This background cultivated a structured mindset that allows me to approach problems systematically.

For my master's degree at King's College London, I delved into various robotics courses, including Robotics Systems, Real-time Systems, Machine Learning, and Sensor and Actuator technologies. I achieved distinction grades in these courses, and they opened up a new world for me - the world of robotics. In this field, I discovered the opportunity to leverage advanced technologies to address complex problems, enabling robots to outperform human capabilities. this problems are quite challenging, but I love Chanllenging!

This newfound passion led me to choose "robot control optimization via reinforcement learning" as the topic for my final thesis. During this process, I acquired valuable knowledge in reinforcement learning and dynamic control within the field of robotics. I wish I could learn further in this field.
